# "BoardTAU: A Modernized and Interactive Web System for Boarding Houses Near Tarlac Agricultural University"

## INTRODUCTION

### Background of the Study

With the rapid advancement of information technology, web-based platforms have become effective tools for addressing real-world problems, including accommodation searching and property management. Previous studies have shown that interactive web-based systems can significantly enhance the efficiency of locating rental properties by providing detailed listings, search and filtering mechanisms, real-time updates, and communication features (Alejo D. Bisquera et al., 2026; Monteverde et al., 2023). However, many existing rental platforms primarily focus on hotels, apartments, or commercial accommodations, often overlooking affordable boarding houses that are more suitable for students and university personnel.

Choosing a suitable accommodation is one of the major challenges faced by students and faculty members, particularly those who come from distant areas and require temporary or long-term housing near educational institutions. Individuals who study or work far from their hometowns often need accommodations that are affordable, safe, and conveniently located near their school or workplace. Boarding houses commonly serve as temporary residences and function as a second home for students, providing not only shelter but also access to shared facilities such as bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry areas. Because of this, securing proper accommodation has become an essential necessity for both students and faculty/instructors pursuing education or professional work outside their local communities (Anwar & Purnama, 2022; Muhammad Akram Hamzah et al., 2022). According to Bisquera et al. (2026), digital solutions for student accommodation have proven to significantly improve access to relevant housing information and reduce the time, cost, and effort associated with traditional housing searches.

Despite the growing demand for suitable accommodations, the process of finding a suitable boarding house remains difficult and time-consuming. Many end users rely on traditional methods such as door-to-door inquiries, asking acquaintances, or checking through posters and word-of-mouth recommendations. These methods are often inefficient, especially for those unfamiliar with the area, often resulting in wasted time, higher transportation costs, and unnecessary stress. The absence of a centralized and updated source of boarding house information further complicates the search process and may negatively affect academic performance, work efficiency, and overall well-being, as highlighted by Anwar and Purnama (2022) and Hamzah et al. (2022). Similar challenges are observed in other countries where students face difficulties in locating affordable and safe housing without digital support (Bisquera et al., 2026).

Locally, Tarlac Agricultural University (formerly Tarlac College of Agriculture) has implemented an online reservation and monitoring system for on-campus dormitories to improve record keeping and communication among students, parents, and dormitory managers(Parazo, 2016). While this system supports accommodation management within the university campus, it is limited to dormitory use and does not address the needs of students and faculty members who seek off-campus boarding houses near the university. Furthermore, earlier boarding house-related systems previously developed within the institution were largely static and limited in functionality, providing only basic information without features such as real-time availability, online booking, advanced filtering, or interactive user communication. These limitations highlight a gap between existing solutions and the current accommodation needs of the university community. This gap highlights the necessity for a web-based platform that provides updated boarding house information and facilitates interaction between students and property owners.

Additionally, boarding house owners face challenges in promoting and managing their properties due to limited access to effective digital tools. Manual promotion methods restrict visibility and reach, making it difficult to update availability, pricing, and property information efficiently. This gap highlights the need for a centralized, interactive, and web-based platform that can improve property exposure, streamline booking processes, and facilitate communication between property owners and potential tenants, ultimately benefiting both end users and property owners (Monteverde et al., 2023).

In response to these challenges, this study proposes the development of BoardTAU, a modernized and interactive web-based platform designed to facilitate the search, booking, and management of boarding houses near TAU. The system will assist students and faculty/instructors in finding suitable off-campus accommodations by providing accurate location information, detailed property listings, real-time availability, and user-friendly features that enhance decision-making and accessibility. At the same time, BoardTAU supports boarding house owners in promoting and managing their properties efficiently. By integrating modern web technologies and user-centered design, the platform aims to provide a practical, scalable, and effective solution that addresses the common difficulties encountered in traditional boarding house searching and improves the overall accommodation search experience within the university community.


### Significance of the Study

This Capstone Project will support SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure by introducing BoardTAU, a modernized and interactive web-based platform that facilitates the search and discovery of boarding houses near Tarlac Agricultural University. By integrating innovative technology, the system reduces the time, effort, and uncertainty associated with traditional, manual boarding house searches.

The study also aligns with SDG 4: Quality Education by ensuring that students, faculty, and staff have convenient access to safe, affordable, and suitable accommodations. By providing real-time listings, advanced filtering options, and detailed property information, BoardTAU allows users to make informed accommodation decisions quickly, freeing time for academic and professional priorities.

For boarding house owners, the system provides an efficient platform to promote and showcase their properties, manage listings, and update availability, enhancing operational management, increasing property visibility, and supporting business growth.

For faculty, instructors and staff members, BoardTAU will help them locate convenient and safe housing near the university, thereby supporting productivity, work–life balance, and overall well-being.

For students, the platform will provide real-time access to boarding house listings, advanced filtering options based on price, location, amenities, and room type, as well as features to submit inquiries and reviews. These features will reduce uncertainty and will improve the efficiency of finding suitable accommodations.

For future researchers, this study will serve as a valuable reference in the development of web-based accommodation management systems, particularly those focused on educational institutions. The findings, design approach, and system evaluation results may be used as a foundation for further research, enhancement, or adaptation to similar contexts.
